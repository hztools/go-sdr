# ADALM-Pluto hz.tools/sdr driver

The PlutoSDR driver was one of second generation drivers originally written in
late 2020, and rewritten around January of 2021. This has gone from being fairly
unstable to one of the most robust and well supported SDR implementations in
the suite.

It's combination of SampleRate range and 12 bit ADC are incredibly compelling
tech.
