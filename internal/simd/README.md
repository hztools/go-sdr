  - This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is
    commemorated here... nothing valued is here.

  - What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning
    about danger.

  - The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours.

  - The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place
    physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited.
